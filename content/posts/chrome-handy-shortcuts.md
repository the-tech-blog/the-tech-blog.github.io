### Chrome Handy Shortcuts

### copy from console

1. Use **copy("AABB")** to copy AABB to clipboard
2. Similarly, if you need to copy an object from the chrome console, select the object and right-click and set it as a global variable. After that object will move to a new variable **temp1**, then run **copy(temp1)** to copy it to the clipboard.
